  labs(title = "Number of Trips by Months",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Total Trips") +
  
  # Apply a dark gray theme to the plot.
  dark_theme_gray() +

  group_by(month) %>% 
  
  # Summarize total trips.
  summarise(total_count = n()) %>% 
  
  # Arrange rows by total counts in descending order.
  arrange(desc(total_count)) %>% 
  
  # Format total counts with comma separators.
  mutate(total_count = comma(total_count)) %>% 
  
  # Create a table with a caption, column alignments, and custom column names.
