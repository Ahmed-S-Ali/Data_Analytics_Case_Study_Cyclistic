Data Preparation
================

## 1) Importing First File

``` r
# Render the R Markdown file "1_Importing_Packages.Rmd" to import the packages.
rmarkdown::render("01_Importing_Packages.Rmd")
```

## 2) Reading The Dataset

``` r
# Importing the dataset from the previously saved RDS file 2.
bike_trips <- readRDS(here("bike_trips_data.rds"))
```

## 3) Counting Rows Before Cleaning

``` r
# Importing the combined dataset from the previously saved RDS file.
nrow(bike_trips)
```

    ## [1] 5719877

## 4) Checking NA

``` r
# Generating a summary table of NA values for each column in the dataset.
# Using kable for better visualizing.
kable(colSums(is.na(bike_trips)))
```

| end_lng            |   6990 |

## 5) Removing Unnecessary Columns

``` r
# Selecting specific columns from the dataset and storing the result into "bike_trips".
bike_trips <- bike_trips %>% select(c(rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, member_casual))
```

## 6) Removing Empty Rows

``` r
# Removing rows and columns with missing values from the dataset.
bike_trips <- remove_empty(bike_trips, which = c("rows", "cols"))

# Removing duplicate rows from the dataset.
bike_trips <- distinct(bike_trips)
```

## 7) Head

``` r
# Displaying the first 5 rows of the cleaned dataset in a table format using kable.
kable(head(bike_trips))
```

## 11) Filter

``` r
# Filtering the 'bike_trips' dataset to include only rows where the 'ended_at' year is less than 2024.
bike_trips <- bike_trips %>% filter(year(ended_at) < 2024)
```

## 12) Saving Dataset

``` r
# Saving the cleaned dataset as an RDS file to ensure that the cleaned dataset can be easily reloaded,
# and used in future analyses without needing to repeat the cleaning steps.
saveRDS(bike_trips, here("bike_trips_data.rds"))
```
